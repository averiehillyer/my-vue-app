I took the cover art and simplified it in order to create a layer that was able to be screenprinted. I chose to do all black with a pop of red because I felt that it helped represent the feeling of sonder and how it can be both isolating (red) and all consuming (black). I added a distressed typeface to compliment the eroded eye image above. I wanted the text to blend in with the image so I kept it black and inverted the type when it is layered over the image.",
