    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>My name is Averie Hillyer and here you will find a website that highlights some of my favorite pieces of work
      that I have created through my studies at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities as a Graphic Designer, in my
      free-time, and even some freelance work as well.</p>
    <p>This site has an extensive bio on myself that discusses my education path, my career interests, as well as some of
      my professional experience that I currently have, and some professional endeavors that I would love to explore.</p>
